This is my first full Python script.
it asks the user for aמ http/s link, fixes it into an IP address, sends ping to the website, if it's available it starts a tcp scan, and if port 22 (SSH) was found open it offers you to attempt brute-force attack, and if it found the correct credentials - it prints them, shows connection options and offer's to send commands to the remote server, Please use it ONLY for legal purposes, it's up to you, Please use wisely and enjoy :)
