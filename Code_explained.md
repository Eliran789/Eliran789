This is my first full Python script, it asks the user for a http/s link, fixes it into an IP address, sends ping to the website, if it's available it starts a tcp scan, and if port 22 (SSH) was found open it automatically tries random username and password, and if it found the correct ones, it prints them, shows connection options and offer's to send commands to the remote server, Please use it ONLY for legal purposes, it's up to you, Please use wisely and enjoy :)
